> 🧠 **Brains complement:** IF an `unreal-engine-skills-manager` tool (external MCP) exists in this session, call it with `{action: "load", skill: "automation-and-testing"}` for UE domain knowledge on this topic — correct APIs, architecture, best practices — and treat it as the rubric for any review / "best practices" question. If no such tool is available (e.g. running under Claude Code or Codex without that MCP), skip this line entirely and proceed with this skill alone — do NOT attempt the call.

# Play-In-Editor (PIE) Testing Skill

PIE is the only way to validate runtime behavior — Blueprint logic, AI ticking, animation, input, widget interaction, gameplay events. Without starting PIE, your "fix" is unverified.

## PIE control — engine `EditorAppToolset`

Generic PIE start/stop/status is owned by Unreal 5.8's native **`EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset`**,
invoked through `call_tool` (run `describe_toolset` on it for exact action names/params):

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `StartPIE` | Start PIE if not already running. Succeeds (no-op) if already running. |
| `StopPIE` | End the current PIE session. Succeeds if stopped or already stopped. |
| `IsPIERunning` | `True` if PIE or Simulate-In-Editor is active. |
| `CaptureViewport` | Screenshot the active viewport (use to visually verify runtime state). |

```
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="IsPIERunning")
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StartPIE")
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StopPIE")
```

> PIE start/stop/query is **not** on `WidgetService` anymore for general testing — use the engine
> toolset above. `WidgetService` still owns the widget-in-PIE validation helpers below.

## Standard Test Loop

For repeatable multi-step verification, prefer `WorkflowService.run_scenario()` over hand-composing
the loop. It queues a state machine on editor ticks, waits for actual PIE readiness, scopes log
assertions to the scenario start, uses VibeUE's focus-free input injection, captures evidence, and
always tears PIE down on pass, failure, or cancellation. Poll `get_scenario(id)` until its `status`
is `passed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `smoke_passed`, or `stale`:

```python
import json, unreal
spec = {
  "name": "secondary fire consumes ammo",
  "preflight": {"save_dirty_assets": True, "compile_blueprints": ["/Game/Weapons/BP_Rifle"]},
  "steps": [
    {"action":"start_pie"},
    {"action":"wait_for_pie", "timeout_seconds":30},
    {"action":"inject_action", "path":"/Game/Input/IA_Fire_Secondary"},
    {"action":"wait", "seconds":0.25},
    {"action":"assert_log", "contains":"SecondaryFire"},
    {"action":"capture_game", "name":"after-secondary-fire"}
  ],
  "teardown": {"stop_pie": True}
}
queued = json.loads(unreal.WorkflowService.run_scenario(json.dumps(spec)))
# Poll in separate tool calls; do not block the editor game thread with time.sleep.
```

Use the lower-level primitives below for interactive investigation, one-off probes, or actions not in
the scenario schema. Never spin/sleep inside one editor Python call while waiting for a scenario.

### Assertions and evidence freshness

A normal scenario must declare at least one `assert_log`, `python_assert`, or
`python_assert_number` step. Completing input/wait/capture steps alone does not verify gameplay.
For a deliberate boot-only check, set `"smoke": true`: an assertion-free run finishes with
`status="smoke_passed"` and `passed=false`. Pollers must treat `smoke_passed` and `stale` as terminal
alongside `passed`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.

`python_assert` compares the Python result with a required string `expected`.
`python_assert_number` evaluates an expression and requires a finite numeric result:

```json
{"action":"python_assert_number", "expression":"0.1 + 0.2",
 "operator":"eq", "expected":0.3, "tolerance":0.00001}
```

Operators are `eq`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, and `ge`; nonnegative `tolerance` is supported only for `eq`
and defaults to zero. For gameplay, use an expression reading a live actor/property instead of
the arithmetic example. Expected/actual values are recorded per assertion; an expression error,
nonnumeric result, or unmet comparison fails the scenario. Do not cache PIE objects in globals.
If an `assert_log` supplies both `contains` and `not_contains`, both conditions must hold.
Log assertions use the active log (including `-abslog` overrides); unavailable or truncated logs
fail the assertion, including negative checks.
Reports include `assertionsDeclared` and `assertionsEvaluated`, including failed assertions.

To detect stale evidence, add a top-level `dependencies` array of actual file paths relative to the
project directory (or absolute paths), for example `Content/Ships/BP_Ship.uasset` and relevant
source/config files. Dependencies must exist. VibeUE hashes their contents after preflight,
records the scenario hash and engine version, and automatically tracks its plugin DLL when
dependencies are provided. It does not persist the submitted Python source as provenance.

`get_scenario()` checks those hashes again for completed reports, including reports loaded from
disk. A changed/missing file or changed engine version produces `validity="stale"`; a historical
pass then returns `status="stale"`, `passed=false`, and `historicalPassed=true`.
`verifiedCurrent=true` requires passing assertions and unchanged tracked inputs. Without
dependencies, `validity="untracked"` and `verifiedCurrent=false`, even if assertions passed.
Freshness covers only explicitly listed files plus the plugin DLL: it does not infer transitive
asset dependencies, detect unsaved edits, or prove a newly changed project binary is loaded.
Save and compile first, list all relevant inputs, and rerun after changes. Hashes are freshness
checks, not tamper-proof attestations. Large dependency sets increase polling cost.

These verification improvements were inspired by
[PageMastr/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/PageMastr/Gatekeeper), particularly its assertion coverage
and source-bound verdicts. The VibeUE implementation is independently written for Unreal.

```
# 1. Make sure you're starting from a clean state
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StopPIE")   # no-op if not running

# 2. Start the session (uses the editor's current PIE settings — default map, viewport)
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StartPIE")

# 3. Let the test run / inspect log output (LogsToolset) / interact via other services
# 4. Stop when done
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StopPIE")
```

## Net mode from Python — `EngineSettingsService`

`StartPIE` uses the editor's saved PIE settings, so set the net mode BEFORE starting the session.
`EngineSettingsService` reads and writes `ULevelEditorPlaySettings` directly and persists the
change, so a dedicated-server PIE gate no longer means quitting the editor to hand-edit
`EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini` and relaunching:

```python
import unreal

# Read the current PIE multiplayer settings
info = unreal.EngineSettingsService.get_pie_settings()
print(info.net_mode, info.num_clients, info.run_under_one_process)

# Set dedicated-server PIE: 1 client, all windows in one process
ok = unreal.EngineSettingsService.set_pie_settings("Client", 1, True)   # returns True only on verified write
# Verify by readback, never by return value alone
assert unreal.EngineSettingsService.get_pie_settings().net_mode == "Client"
```

- `net_mode` maps `EPlayNetMode`: `"Standalone"` | `"ListenServer"` | `"Client"`. **`"Client"` is
  dedicated-server PIE** — the editor's "Play As Client", where a windowless dedicated server is
  spawned behind the scenes and PIE instance 0 is that server (`"DedicatedServer"` is accepted as an
  alias for `"Client"`).
- `set_pie_settings` refuses an unknown net mode or a `num_clients` outside 1-10 (returns `False`,
  logs a Warning), and returns `False` if any written value fails to read back.
- **These are per-USER config, not project config** — they live in
  `Saved/Config/<Platform>/EditorPerProjectUserSettings.ini` and follow the machine, not the repo.
  Do not expect a teammate or CI to inherit them; set them from the gate itself.

## Validating widgets in PIE — `WidgetService`

VibeUE keeps a small set of widget-in-PIE helpers on `unreal.WidgetService` (run them via
`execute_python_code`). These spawn and inspect live widget instances once PIE is running:

```python
import unreal

# After StartPIE, spawn a widget instance into the running viewport
handle = unreal.WidgetService.spawn_widget_in_pie("/Game/UI/WBP_HUD", 0)

# Read a live property off the running instance
val = unreal.WidgetService.get_live_property(handle, "HealthText", "Text")

# Tear it down before stopping PIE
unreal.WidgetService.remove_widget_from_pie(handle)
```

`unreal.WidgetService.is_pie_running()` also still exists and is handy from inside Python; for
tool-level control prefer the engine `EditorAppToolset` actions above.

## Driving gameplay input in PIE — `InputService` (issue #550)

Never remap game input assets or send OS keystrokes (SendKeys/AppActivate) to test a mechanic —
inject input directly; no OS window focus needed:

```python
import unreal

# Fire an Enhanced Input action once (value applies for one input tick; loop to hold).
# X/Y/Z map onto the action's value type; Boolean uses X != 0.
print(unreal.InputService.inject_action("/Game/Input/IA_Fire_Secondary"))

# Or send a raw key to the game viewport through Slate ("tap" = down+up; also "down"/"up").
print(unreal.InputService.inject_key("SpaceBar"))
```

Both return JSON with `success` and an `error_code` naming the problem (PIE not running, no player
controller yet, unknown key, ...). `inject_key` additionally rejects a **Simulate In Editor** session
with `SIMULATE_NOT_PLAY`: Simulate has no player game viewport, so the Slate key events would be
dropped. Use `StartPIE` (Play), not Simulate, when driving keys. Its `handled_down` / `handled_up`
fields report whether a Slate widget *consumed* the event, not whether the key reached the player — a
key the game polls with `WasInputKeyJustPressed` lands with `handled_down: false`. Verify from game
state, not from those flags.

## Seeing the game — `capture_image` (issues #544/#546)

The `capture_image` MCP tool with `source="game"` screenshots the PIE viewport **including the
Slate/UMG HUD** and returns a real image block you can look at (plus a PNG under
`Saved/VibeUE/Captures`). This replaces the old `Shot showui` + read-the-file workaround — and
`CaptureViewport` can never see PIE or UI at all.

## Full-rate unfocused verification — `PerformanceService` (issue #549)

An unfocused editor throttles to ~3 FPS, wrecking timed PIE runs. Disable throttling for the
session instead of focus-hacking the window:

```python
unreal.PerformanceService.set_background_throttling(False)   # before the run
unreal.PerformanceService.set_background_throttling(True)    # after
```

## Gotchas

- **Python blocks the game thread, so you cannot sample a value over time in one call.** A loop with `time.sleep()` between reads returns the *same* number every iteration — the world never ticks while your script holds the thread. This makes a working animation look frozen and a stuck one look identical to a healthy one. Take each sample in a **separate** `execute_python_code` call and compare across them:

  ```python
  # WRONG - three identical readings, proves nothing
  for i in range(3):
      print(ai.get_editor_property("SailAngle")); time.sleep(0.4)

  # CORRECT - one reading per call; the elapsed wall-clock between calls is real tick time
  print(ai.get_editor_property("SailAngle"))
  ```
  Convert the difference into the engineering unit you expect and check it: 306° → 709° across ~8 s is 48°/s, which is exactly the 8 RPM that was configured — that is a pass, "the number changed" is not.
- **PIE start is asynchronous.** `StartPIE` returns immediately after `RequestPlaySession` is queued. The world isn't actually playing until the editor processes the request on its next tick. If you need to act inside the running world, give it a tick or poll `IsPIERunning`.
- **Already-running is treated as success.** `StartPIE` succeeds if a PIE session already exists — it does NOT restart. Stop first if you need a fresh session.
- **`StopPIE` tears down the world** via `RequestEndPlayMap`. Spawned PIE widget instances should be removed with `WidgetService.remove_widget_from_pie(handle)` before stopping.
- **Save before starting.** Dirty asset changes are NOT picked up by PIE unless saved/compiled. Always `compile_blueprint(...)` before launching PIE to test Blueprint changes.
- **Don't leave PIE running between tasks.** Subsequent edits (recompiles, asset moves, hot reload) can fail or behave oddly while a PIE world is alive. Call `StopPIE` before returning control to the user.
- **Map-load delegates never fire on PIE start.** `FCoreUObjectDelegates::PreLoadMap` / `PostLoadMapWithWorld` (loading screens, post-load hooks, subsystem map handlers) are skipped because the PIE world is *duplicated* from the editor world, not loaded. To exercise them, trigger a real in-game transition once PIE is up: `unreal.GameplayStatics.open_level(pie_world, "MapName")`.
- **Python globals holding PIE objects CRASH the editor on PIE end.** Module-level variables from `execute_python_code` persist between calls and are GC roots (`FPyReferenceCollector`). If any still reference a PIE object (pawn, subsystem instance, quest/objective, widget) when PIE tears down, the engine asserts in `PlayLevel.cpp` ("Object from PIE level still referenced") and the editor dies. Before stopping PIE — or as the last statement of any call that inspected PIE objects — release them: `del pawn, sub, quest` or set them to `None`. Also holds for a `world` pointer cached across an in-game `open <map>` travel: it goes stale and using it raises "WorldContext requested with invalid context object"; re-fetch `get_game_world()` in the same call that uses it.

## When to use PIE

- Verifying a Blueprint event fires (combine with log inspection — see `LogsToolset`)
- Validating gameplay logic (damage, scoring, state transitions)
- Testing widgets in their real runtime context (combine with `umg-widgets` skill's `spawn_widget_in_pie`)
- Reproducing user-reported runtime bugs

## When NOT to use PIE

- Pure asset/editor validation (use `compile_blueprint`, `find_assets`, etc.)
- Static introspection (use `get_nodes_in_graph`, `get_node_pins`)
- Anything you can verify without a live world — PIE is slow, save it for genuine runtime checks.

## Additional gotchas

- `StopPIE` then `StartPIE` in one Python call fails with "A play session is already running" — the editor does not tick between statements. Split them across calls and confirm with `IsPIERunning`.
- `EditorAssetLibrary.load_asset` returns None while PIE runs, and downstream calls then return 0/None instead of raising (a fake negative). Load assets before `StartPIE`, or find live objects with `ObjectIterator`.
- Match PIE worlds by their `/Game/<path>/UEDPIE_0_<Map>` (server/host) and `UEDPIE_1_` (client) object paths, not by name — roughly 100 stale `/Memory/UEDPIE_*` shells match by name. `vibeue.pie_worlds()` returns them keyed by role, and `UnrealEditorSubsystem.get_game_world()` gives the local one.
- A two-client run is Standalone by default: both worlds read `ROLE_AUTHORITY`, so confirm `get_editor_property("role")` (or `vibeue.role(actor)`) before claiming a host/client result. Read and set the PIE net mode with `get_pie_settings`/`set_pie_settings` (dedicated server = PlayNetMode 2).
- A Server RPC invoked from Python runs LOCALLY and is silently dropped; never Start/StopFire a client world's weapon from Python (it crashes the editor). Move a client pawn through its server copy; control rotation is client-owned.
- `slomo 0.1` stretches a 2 s timer to 20 s of wall time so a transient state survives between calls; restore `slomo 1` after. PIE time restarts each run.
- Never leave an automation test run queued before starting PIE — it wakes on PIE activity and tears the session down.
- Globals in the `execute_python_code` script namespace persist across calls (it is a separate dict from `sys.modules["__main__"]`, so `import __main__` does not see them): use them to collect async tool results (`vibeue.exec_tool_async`/`collect_tool_result`), and release PIE object references (`vibeue.release_globals`) before `StopPIE`.
