> 🧠 **Brains complement:** IF an `unreal-engine-skills-manager` tool (external MCP) exists in this session, call it with `{action: "load", skill: "automation-and-testing"}` for UE domain knowledge on this topic — correct APIs, architecture, best practices — and treat it as the rubric for any review / "best practices" question. If no such tool is available (e.g. running under Claude Code or Codex without that MCP), skip this line entirely and proceed with this skill alone — do NOT attempt the call.

# Play-In-Editor (PIE) Testing Skill

PIE is the only way to validate runtime behavior — Blueprint logic, AI ticking, animation, input, widget interaction, gameplay events. Without starting PIE, your "fix" is unverified.

## PIE control — engine `EditorAppToolset`

Generic PIE start/stop/status is owned by Unreal 5.8's native **`EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset`**,
invoked through `call_tool` (run `describe_toolset` on it for exact action names/params):

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `StartPIE` | Start PIE if not already running. Succeeds (no-op) if already running. |
| `StopPIE` | End the current PIE session. Succeeds if stopped or already stopped. |
| `IsPIERunning` | `True` if PIE or Simulate-In-Editor is active. |
| `CaptureViewport` | Screenshot the active viewport (use to visually verify runtime state). |

```
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="IsPIERunning")
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StartPIE")
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StopPIE")
```

> PIE start/stop/query is **not** on `WidgetService` anymore for general testing — use the engine
> toolset above. `WidgetService` still owns the widget-in-PIE validation helpers below.

## Standard Test Loop

For repeatable multi-step verification, prefer `WorkflowService.run_scenario()` over hand-composing
the loop. It queues a state machine on editor ticks, waits for actual PIE readiness, scopes log
assertions to the scenario start, uses VibeUE's focus-free input injection, captures evidence, and
always tears PIE down on pass, failure, or cancellation. Poll `get_scenario(id)` until its `status`
is `passed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`:

```python
import json, unreal
spec = {
  "name": "secondary fire consumes ammo",
  "preflight": {"save_dirty_assets": True, "compile_blueprints": ["/Game/Weapons/BP_Rifle"]},
  "steps": [
    {"action":"start_pie"},
    {"action":"wait_for_pie", "timeout_seconds":30},
    {"action":"inject_action", "path":"/Game/Input/IA_Fire_Secondary"},
    {"action":"wait", "seconds":0.25},
    {"action":"assert_log", "contains":"SecondaryFire"},
    {"action":"capture_game", "name":"after-secondary-fire"}
  ],
  "teardown": {"stop_pie": True}
}
queued = json.loads(unreal.WorkflowService.run_scenario(json.dumps(spec)))
# Poll in separate tool calls; do not block the editor game thread with time.sleep.
```

Use the lower-level primitives below for interactive investigation, one-off probes, or actions not in
the scenario schema. Never spin/sleep inside one editor Python call while waiting for a scenario.

```
# 1. Make sure you're starting from a clean state
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StopPIE")   # no-op if not running

# 2. Start the session (uses the editor's current PIE settings — default map, viewport)
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StartPIE")

# 3. Let the test run / inspect log output (LogsToolset) / interact via other services
# 4. Stop when done
call_tool(toolset="EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset", tool="StopPIE")
```

## Validating widgets in PIE — `WidgetService`

VibeUE keeps a small set of widget-in-PIE helpers on `unreal.WidgetService` (run them via
`execute_python_code`). These spawn and inspect live widget instances once PIE is running:

```python
import unreal

# After StartPIE, spawn a widget instance into the running viewport
handle = unreal.WidgetService.spawn_widget_in_pie("/Game/UI/WBP_HUD", 0)

# Read a live property off the running instance
val = unreal.WidgetService.get_live_property(handle, "HealthText", "Text")

# Tear it down before stopping PIE
unreal.WidgetService.remove_widget_from_pie(handle)
```

`unreal.WidgetService.is_pie_running()` also still exists and is handy from inside Python; for
tool-level control prefer the engine `EditorAppToolset` actions above.

## Driving gameplay input in PIE — `InputService` (issue #550)

Never remap game input assets or send OS keystrokes (SendKeys/AppActivate) to test a mechanic —
inject input directly; no OS window focus needed:

```python
import unreal

# Fire an Enhanced Input action once (value applies for one input tick; loop to hold).
# X/Y/Z map onto the action's value type; Boolean uses X != 0.
print(unreal.InputService.inject_action("/Game/Input/IA_Fire_Secondary"))

# Or send a raw key to the game viewport through Slate ("tap" = down+up; also "down"/"up").
print(unreal.InputService.inject_key("SpaceBar"))
```

Both return JSON with `success` and an `error_code` naming the problem (PIE not running, no player
controller yet, unknown key, ...).

## Seeing the game — `capture_image` (issues #544/#546)

The `capture_image` MCP tool with `source="game"` screenshots the PIE viewport **including the
Slate/UMG HUD** and returns a real image block you can look at (plus a PNG under
`Saved/VibeUE/Captures`). This replaces the old `Shot showui` + read-the-file workaround — and
`CaptureViewport` can never see PIE or UI at all.

## Full-rate unfocused verification — `PerformanceService` (issue #549)

An unfocused editor throttles to ~3 FPS, wrecking timed PIE runs. Disable throttling for the
session instead of focus-hacking the window:

```python
unreal.PerformanceService.set_background_throttling(False)   # before the run
unreal.PerformanceService.set_background_throttling(True)    # after
```

## Gotchas

- **Python blocks the game thread, so you cannot sample a value over time in one call.** A loop with `time.sleep()` between reads returns the *same* number every iteration — the world never ticks while your script holds the thread. This makes a working animation look frozen and a stuck one look identical to a healthy one. Take each sample in a **separate** `execute_python_code` call and compare across them:

  ```python
  # WRONG - three identical readings, proves nothing
  for i in range(3):
      print(ai.get_editor_property("SailAngle")); time.sleep(0.4)

  # CORRECT - one reading per call; the elapsed wall-clock between calls is real tick time
  print(ai.get_editor_property("SailAngle"))
  ```
  Convert the difference into the engineering unit you expect and check it: 306° → 709° across ~8 s is 48°/s, which is exactly the 8 RPM that was configured — that is a pass, "the number changed" is not.
- **PIE start is asynchronous.** `StartPIE` returns immediately after `RequestPlaySession` is queued. The world isn't actually playing until the editor processes the request on its next tick. If you need to act inside the running world, give it a tick or poll `IsPIERunning`.
- **Already-running is treated as success.** `StartPIE` succeeds if a PIE session already exists — it does NOT restart. Stop first if you need a fresh session.
- **`StopPIE` tears down the world** via `RequestEndPlayMap`. Spawned PIE widget instances should be removed with `WidgetService.remove_widget_from_pie(handle)` before stopping.
- **Save before starting.** Dirty asset changes are NOT picked up by PIE unless saved/compiled. Always `compile_blueprint(...)` before launching PIE to test Blueprint changes.
- **Don't leave PIE running between tasks.** Subsequent edits (recompiles, asset moves, hot reload) can fail or behave oddly while a PIE world is alive. Call `StopPIE` before returning control to the user.
- **Map-load delegates never fire on PIE start.** `FCoreUObjectDelegates::PreLoadMap` / `PostLoadMapWithWorld` (loading screens, post-load hooks, subsystem map handlers) are skipped because the PIE world is *duplicated* from the editor world, not loaded. To exercise them, trigger a real in-game transition once PIE is up: `unreal.GameplayStatics.open_level(pie_world, "MapName")`.
- **Python globals holding PIE objects CRASH the editor on PIE end.** Module-level variables from `execute_python_code` persist between calls and are GC roots (`FPyReferenceCollector`). If any still reference a PIE object (pawn, subsystem instance, quest/objective, widget) when PIE tears down, the engine asserts in `PlayLevel.cpp` ("Object from PIE level still referenced") and the editor dies. Before stopping PIE — or as the last statement of any call that inspected PIE objects — release them: `del pawn, sub, quest` or set them to `None`. Also holds for a `world` pointer cached across an in-game `open <map>` travel: it goes stale and using it raises "WorldContext requested with invalid context object"; re-fetch `get_game_world()` in the same call that uses it.

## When to use PIE

- Verifying a Blueprint event fires (combine with log inspection — see `LogsToolset`)
- Validating gameplay logic (damage, scoring, state transitions)
- Testing widgets in their real runtime context (combine with `umg-widgets` skill's `spawn_widget_in_pie`)
- Reproducing user-reported runtime bugs

## When NOT to use PIE

- Pure asset/editor validation (use `compile_blueprint`, `find_assets`, etc.)
- Static introspection (use `get_nodes_in_graph`, `get_node_pins`)
- Anything you can verify without a live world — PIE is slow, save it for genuine runtime checks.
