> 🧠 **Brains complement:** IF an `unreal-engine-skills-manager` tool (external MCP) exists in this session, call it with `{action: "load", skill: "landscape-and-foliage"}` for UE domain knowledge on this topic — correct APIs, architecture, best practices — and treat it as the rubric for any review / "best practices" question. If no such tool is available (e.g. running under Claude Code or Codex without that MCP), skip this line entirely and proceed with this skill alone — do NOT attempt the call.

## Critical Rules

### Valid Quad Sizes

QuadsPerSection must be one of: **7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255**
SectionsPerComponent must be **1 or 2**

Common setup: `QuadsPerSection=63, SectionsPerComponent=1, ComponentCount=8x8`

### ⚠️ Performance: Landscape Creation Timeout

Creating landscapes with many components is SLOW. Python execution has a 30-second timeout.

**Safe configurations (under 30s):**
- `ComponentCount=4x4` (253x253 resolution) — safe for throwaway/test terrains
- `ComponentCount=8x8` (505x505 resolution) — **can exceed 30s** in a populated level (measured 67s in a level that already had another landscape); safe only in near-empty levels

**Will TIMEOUT (avoid):**
- `ComponentCount=16x16` or larger in a populated level
- `ComponentCount=36x36` or larger — too many components, takes minutes
- `ComponentCount=72x72` — definitely exceeds timeout

**⚠️ A timeout does NOT cancel the operation.** `PYTHON_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT` means the tool stopped waiting — the create keeps running on the game thread and usually completes. **Never blindly retry**: you'd stack a second landscape with the same label (then `delete_landscape` removes only the first match and `landscape_exists` stays true, which looks like a delete failure). After a timeout, check `landscape_exists(label)` first. `create_landscape` also refuses to create a landscape whose label already exists.

### ⚠️ Heightmap Import: Resolution MUST Exactly Match

`import_heightmap()` requires the heightmap file resolution to **exactly match** the landscape resolution. **There is NO automatic scaling.** A size mismatch will fail or produce flat/corrupt terrain.

If the target landscape label does not exist, `import_heightmap()` now auto-creates a matching landscape at world origin with default scale `(100,100,100)` before importing. For real-world terrain workflows, explicitly creating the landscape first is still recommended so you can control XY/Z scale.

**Landscape resolution formula:** `Resolution = (ComponentCount × QuadsPerSection × SectionsPerComponent) + 1`

**Safe performant configs (common resolutions):**

| Components | Quads | Sections | Resolution | km at scale=100 | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| 8×8       | 63    | 1        | **505×505**    | ~0.5 km | Fast, good for prototypes |
| 8×8       | 63    | 2        | **1009×1009**  | ~1.0 km | Good balance of detail/speed |
| 16×16     | 63    | 1        | **1009×1009**  | ~1.0 km | Same resolution, more LOD components |
| 8×8       | 127   | 1        | **1017×1017**  | ~1.0 km | Larger quads, fewer components |
| 16×16     | 63    | 2        | **2017×2017**  | ~2.0 km | Epic recommended for medium landscapes |
| 32×32     | 63    | 1        | **2017×2017**  | ~2.0 km | Same resolution, more LOD components |
| 8×8       | 127   | 2        | **2033×2033**  | ~2.0 km | High detail, fewer components |
| 16×16     | 127   | 1        | **2033×2033**  | ~2.0 km | High detail, more components |
| 32×32     | 63    | 2        | **4033×4033**  | ~4.0 km | Large open world |
| 32×32     | 127   | 2        | **8129×8129**  | ~8.1 km | Max single tile |

**⚠️ 1081×1081 is NOT a valid performant config!** The only config producing 1081 is `36×36 components, 15 quads, 2 sections` — which has 1296 components and **will timeout**. Never request or assume 1081.

### Heightmap ↔ Landscape Sizing Utilities

Four Python utility functions help match heightmaps to landscapes:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `get_heightmap_dimensions(file_path)` | Read width/height/bitdepth of a PNG or RAW heightmap file |
| `resize_heightmap(source, width, height, output, interpolation)` | Resample a 16-bit heightmap to new dimensions. Default `interpolation="bicubic"` (Catmull-Rom, smooth normals); pass `"bilinear"` only if you need the legacy behavior — bilinear upsampling of a low-res DEM produces blocky planar facets on flat plains |
| `calculate_landscape_resolution(cx, cy, quads, sections)` | Compute resolution from landscape config parameters |
| `find_landscape_config_for_resolution(width, height)` | Find the best landscape config that matches a given resolution |

### ✅ Recommended Workflow: Request Matching Resolution

**BEST approach — request the heightmap at the exact resolution you need:**

1. Decide landscape config (e.g., 8×8 components, 63 quads, 2 sections)
2. Calculate resolution: `(8 × 63 × 2) + 1 = 1009`
3. Use `terrain_data generate_heightmap` with `resolution=1009` and `map_size=N`
   - `map_size` controls how many real-world km are captured (default 17.28)
   - Smaller `map_size` = more detail for a specific feature (e.g., 2-5 km for a single mountain)
   - Larger `map_size` = wider area with less per-pixel detail (e.g., 10-20 km for a region)
4. Create landscape with matching config
5. Import heightmap — sizes match perfectly

### ✅ Fallback Workflow: Resize After Download

If you already have a heightmap at a non-matching resolution:

1. Check dimensions: `get_heightmap_dimensions(file_path)`
2. Either:
   - Find a landscape config that matches: `find_landscape_config_for_resolution(width, height)`
   - Or resize the heightmap to match your landscape: `resize_heightmap(source, target_w, target_h)`
3. Create landscape / import resized heightmap

### World Partition landscapes (streaming proxies)

In a **World Partition** level, pass `world_partition_grid_size` (components per proxy grid cell,
e.g. `2`) to `create_landscape` to split the landscape into `ALandscapeStreamingProxy` actors —
the same thing the editor's New Landscape tool does in a WP world:

```python
result = unreal.LandscapeService.create_landscape(
    unreal.Vector(0, 0, 0), unreal.Rotator(0, 0, 0), unreal.Vector(100, 100, 100),
    sections_per_component=1, quads_per_section=63,
    component_count_x=8, component_count_y=8,
    landscape_label="WPLandscape", world_partition_grid_size=2)
```

- The default `world_partition_grid_size=0` keeps the single monolithic `ALandscape` (old behavior).
- The call **fails with an error if the level is not World Partition** — the engine's grid split is
  a silent no-op there, so VibeUE refuses instead of pretending.
- `import_heightmap`, sculpting, painting, and region edits are proxy-transparent: they resolve the
  parent `ALandscape` and fan updates out to every proxy sharing its landscape GUID. Nothing else
  in your workflow changes.

### 🚨 Save semantics: the dirty list lies — audit with `get_last_landscape_write()` + `git status`

On a **World Partition** landscape the engine's dirtying mode (`LandscapeSettings.LandscapeDirtyingMode`,
default *In Landscape Mode And User Triggered Changes*) does **not** mark an edit dirty when it is made
**outside Landscape mode** — and **every** VibeUE/Python edit is outside Landscape mode. The engine
tracks the touched packages in an internal modified-package list instead of the normal dirty flag. The
practical consequences, all measured:

- **`import_heightmap` dirties the proxies but does not save them.** You must save explicitly.
- **A brush / region / semantic op (`flatten_at_location`, `set_height_in_region`, sculpt/smooth/…) can
  write the proxy `.uasset` files to disk during the edit-layer resolve while the editor's dirty list
  shows nothing.** One `flatten_at_location` left 49 proxy files modified on disk with an empty dirty
  list. So the dirty list is **not** a reliable audit of a WP landscape after a brush op.
- **`git status` is the only fully honest audit** (the modified files live under
  `Content/__ExternalActors__/...`; restore an unwanted change with the editor closed via
  `git checkout -- Content/__ExternalActors__/...`).

Two tools make this auditable from Python:

```python
import unreal
svc = unreal.LandscapeService

svc.flatten_at_location("Landscape", 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 250.0)   # any height writer

# What did that write actually touch?
rep = svc.get_last_landscape_write()
print(rep.summary)                       # e.g. "49 proxies dirtied; 49 written to disk by the edit-layer flush (mtime changed)"
print(rep.num_proxies_dirtied, rep.num_written_to_disk, rep.b_any_written_to_disk)
for p in rep.proxies:
    print(p.package_name, "dirty:", p.b_dirty_after, "written:", p.b_written_to_disk, p.file_size_bytes)
```

- **`get_last_landscape_write()`** reports, per proxy package the last write touched: `b_dirty_before` /
  `b_dirty_after` (the unreliable flag) **and** `b_written_to_disk` — an on-disk **mtime** comparison
  bracketing the edit-layer resolve, which is the signal you can trust. `num_written_to_disk` /
  `b_any_written_to_disk` summarise it.
  - *Caveat:* the mtime probe only sees writes that complete **during the MCP call** (around the
    synchronous `ForceUpdateLayersContent` resolve). If the engine ever defers the on-disk save to a
    later editor tick, `b_written_to_disk` reads `false` even though the file changes shortly after —
    so `git status` remains the final word.

- **`save_landscape(label)`** is the deterministic, explicit save: it collects the parent `ALandscape`
  package **plus every proxy sharing the landscape GUID** and saves them all through
  `UEditorLoadingAndSavingUtils::SavePackages(..., only_dirty=False)` — i.e. regardless of the dirty
  flag. Use it after `import_heightmap` (which never saves), or any time you want a clean, audited flush.

```python
res = svc.save_landscape("Landscape")
if res.b_success:
    print("saved", res.num_requested, "packages:", list(res.saved_packages))
else:
    print("save failed:", res.error_message)   # e.g. a read-only / source-controlled file
```

### Blocky / faceted flat areas (plains)

Low-res source DEMs upsampled to landscape resolution show planar facets on flat terrain. Fixes,
in order of preference:

1. `resize_heightmap(..., interpolation="bicubic")` — now the default; re-run the resize+import if
   the landscape was built with an older (bilinear) resize.
2. Increase `blur_passes` (20–40) on `terrain_data generate_heightmap` for plains-heavy regions.
3. Material-level smoothing without touching heights: derive a world-space smoothed normal in the
   landscape material (see `landscape-materials` skill) when height data must stay pixel-exact.

### Landscape Scale

- Default scale `(100, 100, 100)` = 1 meter per unit
- Larger Z scale = taller terrain range (e.g., Z=200 doubles height range)

**⚠️ When importing real-world terrain from `terrain_data`, ALWAYS calculate Z scale:**
```
z_scale = 20000 / height_scale
```
Do NOT hardcode Z scale. The `height_scale` from `preview_elevation` determines the correct Z scale.

### Height Limits (uint16 Saturation)

The heightmap is uint16 (0–65535, midpoint 32768). Maximum world height depends on Z scale:

| Z Scale | Max Height (world units) | Min Height (world units) | Total Range |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 100     | ~25,599                  | ~-25,600                 | ~51,200     |
| 200     | ~51,198                  | ~-51,200                 | ~102,400    |
| 50      | ~12,800                  | ~-12,800                 | ~25,600     |

Formula: `MaxHeight = (65535 - 32768) × (1/128) × ZScale`

When sculpting pushes vertices to 0 or 65535, a saturation warning is logged. To increase range:
- Increase landscape Z scale (halves vertical resolution)
- Offset landscape Z location downward to use the full ±range

### World Coordinates vs Landscape Coordinates

- **Most methods** accept world coordinates (WorldX, WorldY)
- **get_height_in_region** and **set_height_in_region** use landscape-local vertex indices
- Heights in `set_height_in_region` are world-space Z values
- Heights returned by `get_height_in_region` are world-space Z values

### ⚠️ GrassVariety Struct Properties Are Read-Only via Direct Assignment

`GrassVariety` (and its nested structs like `PerPlatformFloat`, `FloatInterval`, etc.) **cannot** be set via direct attribute assignment. You MUST use `set_editor_property()` for all properties.

```python
# WRONG - raises "Property is read-only and cannot be set"
nv = unreal.GrassVariety()
nv.affect_distance_field_lighting = True
nv.grass_density.default = 50.0

# CORRECT - use set_editor_property and construct new struct instances
nv = unreal.GrassVariety()
nv.set_editor_property('affect_distance_field_lighting', True)
nv.set_editor_property('grass_density', unreal.PerPlatformFloat(default=50.0))
nv.set_editor_property('scale_x', unreal.FloatInterval(min=1.0, max=3.0))
```

This applies to ALL nested structs: `PerPlatformFloat`, `PerPlatformInt`, `PerQualityLevelFloat`, `PerQualityLevelInt`, `FloatInterval`, `LightingChannels`. Always construct a **new** struct instance with keyword args.

### ⚠️ Creating LandscapeGrassType Assets Requires AssetTools + Factory

LandscapeGrassType assets are NOT created via LandscapeService. Use `AssetToolsHelpers` with `LandscapeGrassTypeFactory`:

```python
# WRONG - no such method exists
unreal.LandscapeService.create_grass_type("LGT_MyGrass", "/Game/Grass")

# CORRECT - use AssetTools + Factory
asset_tools = unreal.AssetToolsHelpers.get_asset_tools()
factory = unreal.LandscapeGrassTypeFactory()
new_asset = asset_tools.create_asset("LGT_MyGrass", "/Game/Grass", unreal.LandscapeGrassType, factory)
```

### ⚠️ Use LandscapeMaterialService for Landscape Materials - NOT MaterialService

- **CORRECT**: `unreal.LandscapeMaterialService.create_landscape_material("M_Terrain", "/Game/Mats")`
- **WRONG**: `unreal.MaterialService.create_material("M_Terrain", "/Game/Mats")` → causes `TypeError: Nativize: Cannot nativize 'MaterialCreateResult' as 'String'`

`MaterialService` is for generic materials. Landscape materials MUST use `LandscapeMaterialService`.

### Layer Info Objects Required

Every paint layer needs a `ULandscapeLayerInfoObject` asset:
1. Create with `LandscapeMaterialService.create_layer_info_object()`
2. **ALWAYS store and use `.asset_path` from the result** — never guess paths
3. Naming convention is `LI_<LayerName>` (e.g., `LI_Grass`, `LI_Rock`) — NOT `Grass_LayerInfo`
4. Then add to landscape with `LandscapeService.add_layer(landscape_label, info.asset_path)`

### Material Must Be Compiled First

After creating/changing a landscape material, compile it before assigning to the landscape.

### ⚠️ Split Material Operations Into Separate Code Blocks

`compile_material()` can take minutes for complex landscape materials. **NEVER** combine material creation + compile + layer info creation in one code block — it WILL timeout.

Do this in separate steps:
1. **Block 1**: Create material, add blend nodes, add layers, connect, save
2. **Block 2**: `compile_material()` (this is slow)
3. **Block 3**: Create layer info objects, assign to landscape

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

| WRONG | CORRECT |
|-------|---------|
| `create_landscape(..., actor_label="X")` | `create_landscape(..., landscape_label="X")` |
| `result.actor_path` | `result.actor_label` (no actor_path exists) |
| `info.success` | Check `info.actor_label` (no success field on info) |
| `info.num_sections` | `info.num_subsections` |
| `info.quads_per_section` | `info.subsection_size_quads` |
| `MaterialService.create_material()` for landscapes | `LandscapeMaterialService.create_landscape_material()` |
| Guessing layer info path `Grass_LayerInfo` | Use `create_layer_info_object().asset_path` → `LI_Grass` |
| `segment.start_control_point_index` | `segment.start_point_index` (spline segment) |
| `segment.end_control_point_index` | `segment.end_point_index` (spline segment) |
| `layer.name` on list_layers result | `layer.layer_name` (LandscapeLayerInfo_Custom property) |
| `LandscapeService.create_spline_control_point(...)` | `LandscapeService.create_spline_point(...)` (no "control" in name) |
| `LandscapeMaterialService.add_material_layer(...)` | `LandscapeMaterialService.add_layer_to_blend_node(...)` |
| `mat_path = create_landscape_material(...)` as string | Returns `LandscapeMaterialCreateResult` — use `result.asset_path` |
| `connect_spline_points(..., tangent_length=25.0)` ignoring negative source | Pass `tangent_length=seg.start_tangent_length, end_tangent_length=seg.end_tangent_length` — **both** tangents are needed for exact shape |
| Only passing `tangent_length` to `connect_spline_points` | Must also pass `end_tangent_length=seg.end_tangent_length` — end tangent is typically negative (UE convention). Omitting it defaults to `-start_tangent` which is usually correct for NEW splines, but when copying, always pass both explicitly |
| `create_spline_point("L", location=vec)` | Parameter is `world_location`, NOT `location`: `create_spline_point("L", world_location=vec)` |
| `modify_spline_point("L", 0, location=vec)` | Parameter is `world_location`, NOT `location`: `modify_spline_point("L", 0, world_location=vec)` |
| `modify_spline_point(...)` with wrong rotation | Use `auto_calc_rotation=False, rotation=pt.rotation` to set exact rotation from get_spline_info |
| Setting rotation BEFORE `connect_spline_points` | `connect_spline_points` triggers auto-calc rotation — set rotations AFTER all segments are connected |
| `pt.paint_layer_name` on LandscapeSplinePointInfo | Property is `pt.layer_name` (NOT `paint_layer_name`) — `paint_layer_name` is the **parameter** name in `create_spline_point` |
| Reading weights right after painting and getting 0.0 | Weights are written to edit layer — reads use same path |
| `spline_info.points` on LandscapeSplineInfo | Property is `spline_info.control_points` (**NOT** `points`) |
| Not setting spline segment meshes after connecting | Use `set_spline_segment_meshes()` to assign mesh entries (e.g. SM_River) — splines are green without meshes |
| Forgetting to set control point meshes | Use `set_spline_point_mesh()` — control points can have their own static mesh |
| `layer.asset_path` on LandscapeLayerInfo_Custom | Property is `layer.layer_info_path` (**NOT** `asset_path`) |
| Guessing random offset like 110000 for side-by-side | Calculate: `offset = (resolution - 1) * scale.x` e.g. (1009-1)*100 = 100800 |
| Using `FoliageService.clear_all_foliage()` thinking it only clears one landscape | `clear_all_foliage()` removes ALL foliage from the ENTIRE level — use `remove_foliage_in_radius()` or `remove_all_foliage_of_type()` to target specific areas |
| Manually scattering foliage to replicate a landscape that uses LandscapeGrassType | If foliage is procedural (from LandscapeGrassType on the material), just copy paint layers — foliage auto-generates from weights. Check if `list_foliage_types()` returns 0; if so, foliage is procedural. |
| Using `terrain_data` without `resolution` and getting 1081×1081 | Always pass `resolution=N` matching your landscape. Common values: 505, 1009, 1017, 2033 |
| Assuming 1081×1081 heightmap will fit any landscape | 1081 requires 36×36 components which WILL timeout. Use `resolution=1009` (8×8, 63q, 2s) instead |
| Importing a heightmap without checking dimensions | Always call `get_heightmap_dimensions()` first, then `resize_heightmap()` if sizes don't match |
| Creating landscape then downloading heightmap (wrong order) | Decide config → calculate resolution → download at that resolution → create landscape → import |
| `info.scale_x` on LandscapeInfo_Custom | `info.scale.x` — `scale`, `location`, `rotation` are Vector/Rotator structs, not flattened floats |
| Assuming a landscape is centered on its location | It spans **+X/+Y from its location** (corner-anchored): bounds = `location` to `location + (resolution-1)*scale`. A landscape created at (0,0) with 505 res @ scale 100 covers (0,0)–(50400,50400); its center is (25200,25200) |
| `create_layer_info_object("Grass", "/Game/X", "LI_Grass")` | Third param is a **bool**: `create_layer_info_object(layer_name, destination_path, is_weight_blended=True)` — passing a string asset name causes `TypeError: Cannot nativize 'str' as 'bool'` |
| `AssetTools.create_asset(..., unreal.LandscapeLayerInfoObject, None)` to make a layer info | Yields a broken asset with `LayerName=None`, and `layer_name` is **read-only** from Python so it can't be fixed afterwards. Use `LandscapeMaterialService.create_layer_info_object(layer_name, path)` — or `EditorAssetLibrary.duplicate_asset` an existing LayerInfo, which keeps its baked LayerName |
| Retrying `create_landscape` after `PYTHON_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT` | The first call usually still completes in the background — check `landscape_exists(label)` before retrying (duplicate labels now return an error) |
| `result.location` on LandscapeCreateResult | Result has ONLY `success`, `actor_label`, `error_message` — get location via `get_landscape_info(label).location` |
| `result.resolution_x` / `.resolution_y` on HeightmapImportResult | The field is `result.resolution` — a **string** like `"1009x1009"`, not separate ints. Split it if you need numbers. |
| Treating `get_height_at_location()` as a float | It returns a `LandscapeHeightSample` struct — use `.height` (float) and `.valid` (bool); `float(sample)` / `f"{sample}"` raise TypeError |
| Clearing a World-Partition landscape (parent + streaming proxies) | `delete_landscape(label)` now removes the streaming proxies too by default (`include_proxies=True`): it unregisters each `LandscapeStreamingProxy` sharing the landscape's GUID from the `LandscapeInfo`, destroys the proxies, then the parent. Pass `include_proxies=False` for the parent actor only. **Do NOT `destroy_actor` the proxies yourself** — destroying a proxy while the `LandscapeInfo` still references it crashes the editor (access violation in the Landscape module). With the editor closed, deleting the proxy package files under `__ExternalActors__` is the other safe route. |
| `info.component_count_x` / `info.component_count_y` | `info.num_components` is the TOTAL count (e.g. 64 for 8×8) — there are no per-axis fields |
| `info.rotation.x` (Rotator) | Rotator fields are `.roll` / `.pitch` / `.yaw` — there is no `.x/.y/.z` on Rotator (only Vector has those) |

## Related Skills

| Task | Skills to Load |
|------|---------------|
| Sculpt terrain only | `landscape` |
| Simple painted material (LayerBlend) | `landscape` + `landscape-materials` |
| Production auto-material (material functions, RVT, instances) | `landscape` + `landscape-auto-material` |
| Material instance / biome configuration | `landscape-auto-material` |

- **landscape-materials**: Simple landscape materials with `LandscapeLayerBlend` nodes. Good for prototyping with 2-5 layers.
- **landscape-auto-material**: Production-quality auto-materials using material functions, Runtime Virtual Textures, and material instances (Real_Landscape paradigm). Good for shipping quality.

When you need to create or modify the material applied to a landscape, load the appropriate
material skill through `GetSkills` (AgentSkillToolset):

- For simple materials: load `landscape-materials`
- For production auto-materials: load `landscape-auto-material`

> **NOTE**: For landscape material, texture, and layer blending operations, use `LandscapeMaterialService` (load the `landscape-materials` or `landscape-auto-material` skill).

## Sample scripts (run via `execute_python_code`)

- **`scripts/sculpt_terrain.txt`** — create a landscape and sculpt procedural mountain/valley features.

## Additional gotchas

- On a World Partition landscape, verify every sculpt and every reader with a `line_trace_single` grid; the only safe write path is `export_heightmap` -> stamp in Python -> `import_heightmap`. Never synthesise a flat baseline — a flat-plus-pit import erases carved features.
- Pixel mapping: origin is the proxy min corner, `world = min + px * scale`, `worldZ = (H - 32768) * 100/128`, no row flip; check against a known trace height before writing.
- `import_heightmap` does not write proxies to disk — call `save_landscape` (or `save_packages` the Landscape and every proxy). Use `get_last_landscape_write` to see what changed, since the dirty list is unreliable right after landscape calls.
- `flatten_at_location` and `set_height_in_region` read and write the same edit layer now, so a region write stays inside its brush on World Partition; `apply_erosion` was always safe.
- `load_level` from Python leaves all WP cells unloaded for the rest of the session, and `create_landscape` run headless produces a broken landscape (zero heights, no collision).
- Delete a landscape together with its streaming proxies via `delete_landscape(include_proxies=True)`; destroying proxy actors by hand crashes the editor.
- The edit-layer merge can re-surface old garbage after a later merge (a brush spawn, `apply_splines_to_landscape`); re-verify landmarks by trace after any landscape-touching op.
- Spawning any WaterBody auto-spawns a `WaterBrushManager` (`affects_landscape` defaults True) that adds a "Water" edit layer and poisons the terrain; flip that CDO default first and delete any spawned manager. `WaterZone.zone_extent` is on the actor; the river/lake seam material is `lake_transition_material`; `target_wave_mask_depth` is the still-water knob.
