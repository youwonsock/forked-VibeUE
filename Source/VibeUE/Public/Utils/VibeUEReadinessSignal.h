/**
 * Per-process readiness signal for MCP agents (PR #527).
 *
 * VibeUE writes Project/Saved/VibeUE/Signals/editor-<pid>-true.json when FModule::RegisterToolsets()
 * reaches its end, and deletes it on module shutdown / editor pre-exit. Agents that launch the editor
 * via BuildAndLaunchGame.ps1|sh read `Editor-PID=<pid>` from the script output and watch for that one
 * file instead of polling MCP.
 *
 * The signal means only "toolset registration finished for THIS process". Python, World and level
 * readiness remain separate checks.
 *
 * The file carries real JSON (pid, createdUtc, sessionStartUtc, pluginVersion, currentMap, mcpPort,
 * mcpListening) so a watcher can tell a fresh signal from one left behind by a crashed editor whose
 * PID the OS later reused: compare `sessionStartUtc` against the time you launched the process. It is
 * written to a .tmp sibling and moved into place, so a watcher never observes a half-written file.
 *
 * `mcpPort` is the MCP endpoint port and `mcpListening` is whether this process's MCP module reports
 * a running server (issue B6). A socket bind-probe cross-check runs at publish time and logs a loud
 * Error line when the port-8000 fight has left this editor without a listener.
 *
 * `currentMap` is the package name of the loaded editor map ("" when no world is up yet). The signal
 * is re-published on every map open (issue #554), so agents can gate world edits on the right level
 * from the filesystem; `sessionStartUtc` stays stable across re-publishes, `createdUtc` does not.
