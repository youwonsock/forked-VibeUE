/**
 * Performance & tracing service — frame-timing triage, Unreal Insights trace capture, trace+log
 * analysis, and trace-attached standalone play.
 *
 * Unreal 5.8's native toolsets have NO performance or tracing tools, so this is VibeUE's net-new
 * capability: it answers "are we CPU- or GPU-bound?" and drives Insights captures the engine's
 * EditorAppToolset (which can start PIE/Simulate) cannot measure.
 *
 * Recommended flow: FrameTiming() FIRST (CPU vs GPU bound verdict) → StartTrace → reproduce the
 * workload → StopTrace → Analyse. For a representative reading, profile under PIE or a standalone
 * session, not the bare editor viewport. Methods return a JSON string.

	 * investigation — optimising the GPU does nothing if the frame is game- or render-thread bound.
	 *
	 * The verdict is robust: when the top two threads are within a small margin it reports the frame as
	 * "contested" with a confidence level rather than declaring a false winner, and it flags when GPU
	 * timing is unavailable (gpu_ms == 0) so you don't trust a CPU verdict that GPU could overturn.
	 *
	 * Also reports a per-thread budget breakdown against a target frame rate: each thread's headroom
	 * against the per-frame budget and a pass/fail gate, so the same call that triages can also guard.
	 * @param TargetFPS Frame-rate budget to gate against (e.g. 60, 120). Defaults to 60.

	 * TEST/VALIDATION HELPER — deliberately induce a frame hitch on a chosen thread to verify that
	 * FrameTiming's verdict, budget gate and contested detection fire correctly against a KNOWN ground truth.
	 *
	 *   Thread = "game"   -> stall the game thread   `Milliseconds` ms/frame  (expect bound=GameThread)
	 *   Thread = "render" -> stall the render thread `Milliseconds` ms/frame  (expect bound=RenderThread)
	 *   Thread = "both"   -> stall game AND render by the same amount         (expect contested=true)
	 *   Thread = "gpu"    -> supersample via r.ScreenPercentage to force GPU cost, auto-restored after
	 *                        `Frames` frames (scene-dependent best-effort; `Milliseconds` is ignored).
	 *
	 * The CPU paths (game/render/both) are SELF-MEASURING and race-free: the stall is applied
	 * synchronously inside the call and timed directly, so the response carries `observed_peak_game_ms` /
	 * `observed_peak_render_ms` and a `verdict_matched_expect` bool. Validate from THIS single response —
	 * do NOT follow up with FrameTiming, whose read runs on the game thread the stall blocks and reliably
	 * lands on a clean frame. The gpu path is async (cost persists across frames), so for it alone read
	 * FrameTiming on a following frame and confirm `expect`. Total CPU blocking is capped (~10 s) for safety.
	 *
	 * @param Thread       "game" (default), "render", "both", or "gpu".
	 * @param Milliseconds Stall size per frame for the CPU threads. Clamped to [1, 5000]. Ignored for gpu.
	 * @param Frames       Consecutive frames to sustain the hitch. Clamped to [1, 600]; CPU frames further
	 *                     capped so total synchronous stall stays under ~10 s. Use >1 to simulate jitter.
